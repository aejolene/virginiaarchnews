This project is a work in project as I teach myself the ways of web mapping. I'm using this repo to play with the same dataset in sevaral different platforms. The ultimate goal is to have a completely SaaS-independent webmap, but there are so many geat, easy to use tools out there I'm experimenting with them all.
